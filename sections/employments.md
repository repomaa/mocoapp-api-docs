  -H 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "user_id": 123,
        "weekly_target_hours": 29.75,
        "pattern": {

        "to": "2022-12-31",
      }'
```

Mandatory fields are marked with a star (\*):

- **user_id\*** – 123

## GET /users/employments/{id}

Retrieve a single employment:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/users/employments/{id}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## PUT /users/employments/{id}

Update an employment:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  'https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/users/employments/{id}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "weekly_target_hours": 32,
        "pattern": {
          "am": [0, 4, 4, 4, 4],
          "pm": [0, 4, 4, 4, 4]
