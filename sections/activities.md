# Activities
German: "Zeiteinträge"

## Attributes

Activities contain among the standard fields also:
* Project
* Customer
* Task (on the project)
* User (creator)

Attributes `remote_service`, `remote_id` und `remote_url` are set by the MOCO Browser extension and represent a ticket in an external system (Trello, Jira, etc.) that this activity's time was spent on.
